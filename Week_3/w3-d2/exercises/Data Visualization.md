# Data Visualization
## Lie factor
Size of effect in graph (how proportional the size is on the chart)/Size of effect in data. This is part of a well documented literature on graphical representation

## Types of visualizations:
[Directory of visualizations](https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/directory-of-visualizations)

### Visualizing amounts: 
bar plots, group and stacked bars, dot plots, heat maps
### Visualizing distributions:
histograms, density plots, boxplots
### Visualizing proportions:
bars, mosaic plots, tree map
### Visualizing x-y relationships:
scatterplot, bubble chart
### Visualizing geospatial data
choropleth, cartogram

# Principles of DataViz:
Based on Edward Tufte's work.
1. Using proportional ink
	1. The underlying data should be represented proportionally.
2. Use colours that have meaning, or don't use colour at all
3. Use encodings to your advantage
4. Label clearly
5.
